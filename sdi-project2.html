<p>This week's story is about SpongeBob Square Pants! 
<br>Noah, My 18 month old son is my inspiration for this story. 
</p>
<p>Noah, doesn't talk a lot.  He has a vocabulary of only about  <b> five </b> words: No, DaDa, juice, thank you, and SpongeBob.  He loves the show and gets excited everytime he sees that yellow square sponge! 
</p>
<p>I think it's a great topic because there is so much I can do with this theme and maybe have a little fun with it at the same time! <br><br>Thanks & Enjoy!
</p>
<small><p>*Disclaimer: While the story and code for this project is  my sole idea, the concept (SpongeBob Square Pants) and show themes are not mine. I referenced the site 
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/The_SpongeBob_SquarePants_Wiki" target="_blank">SpongeBob Wikia</a> for some factual information on this fictional program.
