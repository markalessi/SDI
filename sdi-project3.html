<p>I decided to continue with the same theme I used last week... SpongeBob Square Pants! 
</p>
<p>I decided to continue with this theme because I think there is still a lot I can do with it. Between my 19 month old son and my 7 year old daughters this show is on quite a bit at my house. I could probably be a Subject Matter Expert on Bikini Bottom.  
</p>
<p>I think it's a great topic because there is so much I can do with this theme and maybe have a little fun with it at the same time! <br><br>Thanks & Enjoy!

<small><p>*Disclaimer: While the story and code for this project is  my sole idea, the concept (SpongeBob Square Pants) and show themes are not mine. I referenced the site 
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/The_SpongeBob_SquarePants_Wiki" target="_blank">SpongeBob Wikia</a> for some factual information on this fictional program.
